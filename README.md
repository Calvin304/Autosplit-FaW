# Autosplit-FaW
autosplitting for the flash versions of the Fireboy and Watergirl franchise

## game support:
currently only faw 1 and 2 are supported (feel free to find the pointer paths and submit a pull request)

## debug:
1. make sure your splits have "Game Name" set correctly, then reload the autospliter.
2. make sure you're using the swfs from this repository.
3. make sure you're using flash player projector (NOT DEBUGGER) 32.0.0.465

if these steps havent worked, file an issue with as much detail as can be provided
